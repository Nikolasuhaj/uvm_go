    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi! I’m Nikola (or Nik), and I’m from the Czech Republic. My background is in preschool and afterschool education, which has always been my passion. After earning my teaching degree, I was eager to improve my English, so I moved to Boston to study. Before that, I worked as a kindergarten teacher in Prague. I spent five wonderful years in Boston, balancing my studies and work before returning to the Czech Republic, where I worked at Accenture and HP in both Prague and Grenoble.

Later, I relocated to Belfast, Northern Ireland, to pursue a degree in Business and Management Studies at Ulster University. During the school year, you can find me on the Trinity campus. In the winter, I enjoy skiing, playing, and volunteering at Jay Peak, and in the summer, I usually visit my family in Southern Moravia and explore that beautiful region.

I have a deep love for travel and discovering new countries, and I’d be thrilled to show you the beauty of my homeland, Prague. I’d love to create a memorable experience for you!</p>

    <h2>Adventures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prague is charming </strong> - We’ll spend a total of three nights in Prague. Our adventure will begin with a stroll through Old Town Square, followed by a walk across the river to catch a tram that will take us up the hill, where we can leisurely stroll down to the castle. We’ll explore the areas associated with Kafka and wander around Lucerna, where Václav Havel’s grandfather built some stunning architectural gems. Throughout our time, we’ll enjoy plenty of walking, take trams or the subway, savor delicious Czech cuisine, and experience the magic of Prague at night.</li>
        <li><strong>Terezin is our history</strong> - Terezin is about an hour away by bus from Prague. This town served as a place where people were sent to work during World War II, and it holds an important part of our history. Understanding its past is essential, as we must remain aware to ensure that such events are never repeated.</li>
        <li><strong>Český Krumlov</strong> - Located three hours south of Prague enchants with its cobbled Old Town, unique Baroque theater, and vibrant castle, giving the town a timeless, almost otherworldly quality. Historically, it has drawn visitors from near and far. Nestled on a hairpin bend of the Vltava River, it has served as a safe haven for Celtic, German, and Slavic tribes throughout the ages. During its Golden Age in the 16th century, Český Krumlov became a vibrant hub for artists, scientists, and alchemists from across Europe, enriching its cultural heritage.
We will spend two nights here, exploring the town and walking up and down Kleť Mountain, with the possibility of going white-water rafting on the Vltava River.</li>
    </ul>
